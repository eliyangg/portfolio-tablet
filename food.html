                    <h3>Fleetwood Diner</h3>
                    <p>Fleetwood is great for cheap and fast food, especially late at night because it is open 24 hours! My personal favorite is the bacon cheeseburger and fries, but Fleetwood diner is also famous for their Hippie Hashes and omelets. What is Hippie Hash? It’s homemade hash browns topped with grilled tomato, green pepper, onion, mushroom and broccoli topped with feta cheese. 
                        They also feature a variety of foods like burgers, milkshakes, omelets and traditional Greek foods and salads. There’s also a great atmosphere with stickers covering all four walls! Visit Fleetwood and bring a sticker to put wherever you can!</p>

                    <p>Chela's has amazing authentic Mexican food, from tacos to burritos to quesadillas. Adrian Iraol, the founder of Chela's, is a native of Mexico City. His father owned parking lots; each one had a stand that sold tacos. Chela's was also voted the best mexican food by the Michigan Daily readers. 
                        My personal favorite is the Daily Special, which comes with two tacos or tamales with rice, beans, and a soft drink. The Al Pastor tacos are amazing with this meal!</p>

                    <h3>Kang's Korean Restaurant</h3>
                    <p>Kang's Korean Restaurant was founded in 1980 as a simple coffee shop selling Korean donuts. As years passed, the small local coffee shop transformed itself into one of the most popular Korean restaurants in Ann Arbor. 
                        Many locals still refer to this campus area diner as Kang’s Coffee Break, due to its beginnings as a small coffee shop. But today it’s a great place to enjoy the famous Korean dish hot stone bibimbap, an incredibly hot stone bowl filled with rice, vegetables, bulgogi, spicy gochujang sauce, and a runny fried egg. 
                    My favorite here is the Duk Bok Ki with Potstickers!</p>

                    <h3>No Thai</h3>
                    <p>NoThai is a local chain that has an amazing variety of Thai food. Jeffery Cho and his business partners Brian Kim and Noerung Hang opened No Thai in 2005.
                         My favorite here is the Pad Seeyu or the Fried Rice. NoThai lets you choose the type of protein and the level of spice in each dish, and has gluten free options on the menu! 
                        They have locations on South U, Kerrytown, S. Main, and on Plymouth road, so it's available anywhere on campus if you’re craving some asian food. </p>

                    <h3>Frita Batidos</h3>
                    <p>Frita Batidos is inspired by Cuban culture around two staples in the world of Cuban street food – The FRITA – a burger traditionally made from spicy chorizo served with s
                        hoestring fries on top in a soft egg bun and BATIDOS – tropical milkshakes made with fresh fruit, crushed ice, and sweetened milk – with or without rum! Michigan native Eve Aronoff Fernandez opened this eatery as a love letter to the Cuban culture that she was immersed in 
                        when she would visit her grandmother in Miami as a child. Located near Ann Arbor’s Kerrytown district, the Frita is my favorite here with an egg on top!</p>

                    <h3>Tomukun</h3>
                    <p>Tomukun Noodle Bar is Ann Arbor’s first local noodle shop that serves Asian comfort food. They use the freshest ingredients and offer the tastiest food. They 
                        also feature a Korean BBQ spot next door. The location, the owner said, positions the restaurant close to campus but also close to the downtown business district, reflecting his target audience of 
                        both students and professionals. From bowls of spicy ramen, savory udon and rich pho to the delicate rich dishes of fried pork katsu and chicken karaage, you have a wide variety of
                        dishes to choose from. My favorite here is the Creamy Pork Ramen!

                    <p>Zingermans’ menu features a wide variety of world-famous sandwiches! Tucked in the heart of Kerrytown, Zingerman’s was opened when owners Ari Weinzweig and Paul Saginaw, 
                        having been disillusioned by the rigid nature of the corporate food world, set out to reintroduce quality and culinary tradition to the folks of Ann Arbor.  They focus on the integrity of their recipes and ingredients, which shows in the taste of their 
                        yummy sandwiches. The atmosphere is buzzing with Ann Arbor locals and visitors alike, at the restaurant that is consistently ranked as one of America’s best Jewish delis. </p>

                    <h3>Aventura</h3>
                    <p>When restaurateur Sava Farah bought the 1800s building Aventura exists in, she was immediately inspired by the history, the patina, and the character of the space. The entire restaurant is lively and rich, like a visit to a European bazaar. Aventura’s location on E. Washington Street is especially ideal for those who work in Ann Arbor office space in the downtown area. 
                        Located next to several buildings with Ann Arbor commercial office space, Aventura is an Ann Arbor culinary gem not to be missed.Start your culinary adventure with pan con tomate, Aventura’s take on bruschetta, or order a ton of tapas. </p>

                        availability and sustainability. The appetizers also include a salmon sashimi with garlic, scallion, and truffle soy sauce. The restaurant on East Liberty near South State seeks to build a dinner clientele with the new concept and locally sourced menu.

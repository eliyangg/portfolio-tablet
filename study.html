                <h2>Michigan Union</h2>
                <p>The Michigan Union is the perfect place to study, which many spaces that range from being super quiet to being able to comfortably talk to a friend. If you need a caffeine boost
                    while studying, the Union has a Panera Bread and a Sweetwaters. If you're looking for a bite to eat, the Union also houses a Subway and a Panda Express! 
                    While youâ€™re here, be sure to stroll through the historic halls, enjoy the beautifully restored architectural details and imagine all the Wolverines who 
                    have come through the doors. It is located at the intersection of South State Street and South University Avenue in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>

                <h2>Law Library</h2>
                <p>If you're looking for somewhere super quiet to get some work done, the Law Libary is the perfect place. Designed in the English Gothic style, it is one of the most recognizable buildings on campus. 
                    It was built between 1924 and 1933 by the architectural firm York and Sawyer, with funds donated by attorney and alumnus William W. Cook. This stunning architectural masterpiece looks like something you'd see at Hogwarts, 
                    but it's actually a real place you can visit. The library, which opened in 1931, is located at 801 Monroe St. in Ann Arbor. The U-M Law Library is maintained and administered as a part of the instruction and research operation of the Law School, but is open to the public.</p>

                <h2>The Fishbowl</h2>
                <p>The Fishbowl is another great place to study, especially after class. Most University of Michigan students have had a class in Mason or Angell Hall during their four years,
                    and the Fishbowl is a super convenient place to get some homework done right afterwards. This is one of the louder spots to study, as people are coming in and out.
                    There are also lots of printers and computers here for students to use. The Fishbowl is located in Mason Hall and is open from 10 a.m. to 12 a.m. every single day.

                <h2>University of Michigan Museum of Art</h2>
                <p>The University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA) in Ann Arbor, Michigan with 94,000 sq ft is one of the largest university art museums in the United States. 
                    Built as a war memorial in 1909 for the university's fallen alumni from the Civil War, Alumni Memorial Hall originally housed U-M's Alumni office along with 
                    the university's growing art collection. One of the finest university art museums in the country, UMMA holds collections representing 150 years of art collecting 
                    with over 20,000 works of art that span cultures, eras, and media.</p>

                <h3>Behind the Walls</h3>
                <p>The 25-foot sculpture of an elongated human head with hands covering both eyes was created by Spanish artist Jaume Plensa and signifies deep reflection, according to a museum news release. 
                    Created using polyester resin and marble dust, the art will tower over passersby and visitors. </p>

                        replica of an eight-foot mastodon tusk. These footprints were cast from a trail left by a mastodon near Saline, Michigan. This is the only mastodon trackway ever found! </p>

                    <p>Peak bloom in the Peony Garden typically runs from Memorial Day (late May) to the summer solstice (mid-June). The peak bloom can vary by 10 days from year to year, depending on the weather. 
                        Warm weather makes the plants bloom early.</p>

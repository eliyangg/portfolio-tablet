                <h2>Yost Ice Arena</h2>
                <p>The Yost Ice Arena, located at 1116 South State Street, plans to resume public skates at Yost in December 2021 or January 2022. Public Skate gives you the chance to skate on the same ice as the Varsity 
                    Hockey Team and skate at one of the most recognized and iconic rinks in college hockey. Built in 1923, Yost Field House was the largest indoor building of its kind on any
                     campus in the United States. It was named in honor of Fielding Harris Yost, legendary coach of Michigan's football teams from 1901-24 and Director of Intercollegiate Athletics from 1921 until his retirement in 1941.  </p>
